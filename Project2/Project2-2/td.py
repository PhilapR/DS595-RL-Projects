    Temporal Difference
    In this problem, you will implememnt an AI player for cliffwalking.
    The main goal of this problem is to get familar with temporal diference algorithm.
    You could test the correctness of your code 
    by typing 'nosetests -v td_test.py' in the terminal.
    
    You don't have to follow the comments to write your code. They are provided
    as hints in case you need.
